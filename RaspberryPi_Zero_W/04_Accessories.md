# Accessories

The following section has all the accessories I'm using with my iPad Pro, including the Raspberry Pi accessories. Feel free to purchase them from the provided links or any other online store, also you may choose different models or brands based on your needs and budget.

1. **iPad Pro**: Obviously you need an iPad but there are different models. I only have tried with an iPad Pro, specifically the 11-inch display model. I choose this one instead of the 12.9-inch model for mobility sake, I don't need a larger display and I think 11" is enough for programming and all the basic task I usually do.

   Purchased on the [Apple Store](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro)

2. **iPad Pro Magic Keyboard**: You can use the iPad Pro without a keyboard but it's much better if you have a keyboard, a mouse and an iPad stand. I chose the Magic Keyboard to have all of them all in one, also comes with a USB-C port for charging, very convenient to continue charging when you have the Raspberry Pi plugged in the only USB C port of the iPad. It is not cheap compared to other keyboard or cases, but it worth it.

3. **Raspberry Pi Zero W**: The Raspberry Pi Zero W is a great accessory when you need a more real Linux environment compared to iSH, and when you need a local Linux environment instead of a remote or cloud server, very useful when you don't have internet or not enough speed. I choose the RPi Zero W instead the RPi 4 because of the size and the low power I need for the task I do. If you need more power, then go for the Raspberry Pi 4 or latest model, it is a bit larger but still small enough to carry it in your pocket or backpack.

   Purchased on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Zero-Wireless-model/dp/B06XFZC3BX) but it's also available on [multiple approved stores](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/).

4. **microSD Memory Card**: This is not an accessory but it's a requirement for the Raspberry Pi (any model).  I choose a Samsung EVO of 256 GB but there are many brands and sizes (GB) to select. I recommend to have enough size for the work you'll be doing as well as a model fast enough, there are plenty of articles about it.

   Purchased on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MicroSDHC-Adapter-MB-ME32GA-AM/dp/B0887P21Z2).

5. **Raspberry Pi Zero W Case**: It's very important to protect your Raspberry Pi, there are plenty of models, different designs, different budgets and needs (if you need access to the GPIO, with touchscreen, USB hubs, etc...). The Zebra model comes with a heatsink, it does not have access to GPIO which I don't need at the moment, it's compact and with a clear top.

   Purchased on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HP636I4).

6. **USB C to mini USB cable**: To have SSH over USB connection you need a USB-C to mini-USB cable. This one is small (1 feet) and works. Not all the cables works, so make sure to choose a good one.

   Purchased on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08K39QFVN).

Other accessories you will need at least one time are:

- SD or microSD card reader: The reader is required to install the Raspberry Pi OS into the microSD. I have a iPad USB C Hub which comes with a microSD reader that I use for many other things and also a single USB reader.

  Both purchased on Amazon, the [UCB-C hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VX46FPK) and the [USB reader](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G5JV2B5).
